<br>
Welcome to my second mod ever released, a companion mod to <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/users/Froggy/activity">Froggy's</a> <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/mod-stonehearth-cafe-cooking-and-farming-expansion-1-4/10159">Stonehearth Cafe (Cooking And Farming Expansion) 1.4</a>, In this mod I have added Distiller workbench for the cook as well as a few more drink recipes using the Distiller and I have added harvestable Wild Mushrooms, Wild Blueberries, Wild Strawberries, Roses and Allium that spawn in the gameworld, there are also new ingredients I have added; Yeast, Cocoa Powder and Sugar.<br>
I have added a growable apple tree sapling which can be planted and will give apples as a resource also *(I will be working on a better model of the apple tree)*
<br><br>
This mod borrows models and code snippets with permission from <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/users/Froggy/activity">Froggy's</a> <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/mod-stonehearth-cafe-cooking-and-farming-expansion-1-4/10159">Stonehearth Cafe (Cooking And Farming Expansion) 1.4</a> for the drink containers and the serving containers and various code snippets.
<br><br>
I have removed all conflicting code and objects from my mod so that my mod works in unison with <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/mod-stonehearth-cafe-cooking-and-farming-expansion-1-4/10159">Stonehearth Cafe (Cooking And Farming Expansion) 1.4</a> without the Food Buff Observer created by <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/users/repeatpan/activity">RepeatPan</a> which means I have removed the Buffs gained from the various drinks for now. I plan to add buffs again in the near future.

<ul>
<li><b>Functional Distiller</b> <i>(A new workbench for the cook profession, built by the cook using 2 wood, 3 copper ingots and 1 empty wood barrel)</i> The distiller gives the cook the new ability to brew drinks such as Mead, Fortified Pine Wine and lots more.</li>
<br>
<li><b>9 New Crops</b> <i>(Crops are planted the same as standard crops by the Farmer)</i> The new crops are growable and harvestable and produce new resources like; Strawberries, Blueberries, Tomatoes, Garlic, Cocoa Beans, Sugarcane, Rice, Watermelon and Grapes.</li><br>
<li><b>Harvestable Wild Mushrooms, Blueberries, Strawberries and Flowers</b> <i>(Harvestable by using the standard harvesting selection tool)</i> Groups of wild mushrooms, roses, allium, blueberries and strawberries will now spawn in the gameworld automatically and spawn on all terrain. Wild Mushrooms can be used by the cook to create Yeast, Blueberries and Strawberries can be eaten raw or used by the cook.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Storage Barrel</b> <i>(Used in the recipe for the distiller and can be placed just like any other stroage/decoration.)</i> The storage barrel is created by the carpenter and requires level 1 and 4 wood.</li>
<br>
<li><b>14 Drink Recipes</b> <i>(Created with the distiller workbench.)</i> The drink recipes are always being added to but for now there are 14 drinks available utilizing ingredients from stonehearth, stonehearth cafe and ingredients from this mod. For a comprehensive list of all ingredients you can check the wiki: <a href="http://github.com/kurohito/brewerymod/wiki/Home">Brewery Mod Wiki</a></li>
</ul><br><br>

In the upcoming future I plan on adding these features:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Buffs to go with the various drinks</li>
<li><s>Even More drink recipes</s><img src="http://i794.photobucket.com/albums/yy224/blindrite/Brewery%20Mod/check_small_icon.png"></li>
<li>Animated distiller workbench</li>
<li><s>Turn barrels into storage for drinks.</s><img src="http://i794.photobucket.com/albums/yy224/blindrite/Brewery%20Mod/check_small_icon.png"></li>
<li><s>More harvestable and growable crops, plants, flowers and resources.</s><img src="http://i794.photobucket.com/albums/yy224/blindrite/Brewery%20Mod/check_small_icon.png"></li>
</ul>
