<br>
Welcome to my second mod ever released, a companion mod to <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/users/Froggy/activity">Froggy's</a> <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/mod-stonehearth-cafe-cooking-and-farming-expansion-1-4/10159">Stonehearth Cafe (Cooking And Farming Expansion) 1.4</a>, In this mod I have added Distiller workbench for the cook as well as a few more drink recipes using the Distiller and I have added harvestable Wild Mushrooms that spawn in the gameworld, there is also a new ingredient I have added; Yeast.
<br><br>
This mod borrows models and code from <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/users/Froggy/activity">Froggy's</a> <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/mod-stonehearth-cafe-cooking-and-farming-expansion-1-4/10159">Stonehearth Cafe (Cooking And Farming Expansion) 1.4</a> for the drink containers and the serving containers.
<br><br>
I have removed all conflicting code and objects from my mod so that my mod works in unison with <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/mod-stonehearth-cafe-cooking-and-farming-expansion-1-4/10159">Stonehearth Cafe (Cooking And Farming Expansion) 1.4</a> which means I have removed the Well and Apiary but it can be found in <a href="http://discourse.stonehearth.net/t/mod-stonehearth-cafe-cooking-and-farming-expansion-1-4/10159">Stonehearth Cafe (Cooking And Farming Expansion) 1.4</a> and works in the same way.

<ul>
<li><b>Functional Distiller</b> <i>(A new workbench for the cook profession, built by the cook using 2 wood, 3 copper ingots and 1 empty wood barrel)</i> The distiller gives the cook the new ability to brew drinks such as Mead, Fortified Pine Wine and lots more.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Harvestable Wild Mushrooms</b> <i>(Harvestable by using the standard harvesting selection tool)</i> Groups of wild mushrooms will now spawn in the gameworld automatically and spawn on all terrain. Wild mushrooms can be used by the cook to create Yeast.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Decorative Barrel</b> <i>(Used in the recipe for the distiller and can be placed just like any other decoration.)</i> The decorative barrel is created by the carpenter and requires level 1 and 4 wood.</li>
<br>
<li><b>8 Drink Recipes</b> <i>(Created with the distiller workbench.)</i> The drink recipes are being added to but for now there are 8 drinks available utilizing ingredients from stonehearth, stonehearth cafe and ingredients from this mod.</li>
</ul><br><br>

<br>
In the upcoming future I plan on adding these features:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Buffs to go with the various drinks</li>
<li>Even More drink recipes</li>
<li>Animated distiller workbench</li>
<li>Turn barrels into storage for drinks.</li>
<li>More harvestable and growable crops, plants, flowers and resources.</li>
</ul>
